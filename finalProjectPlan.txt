"SoundCloud" I will be creating a website using HTML and CSS that demonstrate the ethical issues of the music streaming platform, Soundcloud. I will look at the following issues:

1) Artist benefiting from copyright material (remixes, intellectual property, social issues).

2) Soundcloud artists making little to no money from their work. (Human Factor)

3) The impact of SoundCloud on cultures as a whole. (Social issues)

design activity
Design a chart, quote, graphic, slide, infographic, or other data visualization about the ADIK system you are exploring this semester, which you want to use in your final project.

As you design, ponder this: How does good design serve your viewers or users when you are creating something? How is this an issue of ethics? Answer those questions here.
